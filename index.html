          My dearest love 💖,<br><br>
          From the moment we met, you changed everything. Your eyes, your smile, your soul — they all became the light that guides me. 🌟 I never knew love could feel so deep, so peaceful, and so powerful until you showed me. 🥺💫<br><br>
          Every second with you is a moment I cherish, and every word you speak is music to my heart 🎶. Through good days and bad, your love gives me strength, and your presence gives me peace 🕊️.<br><br>
          I promise to love you more every single day, to protect your heart like it’s my own, and to stay by your side forever — through every laugh, every tear, every memory yet to come 🥰. Thank you for choosing me, for trusting me, and for being my forever and always 💍.<br><br>
          I love you endlessly, Ishma. This page is just a tiny reflection of how deeply you're cherished. ❤️
